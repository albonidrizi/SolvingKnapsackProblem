## Knapsack problem

We worked on this algorithm in the 2nd year of the Faculty of Computer Science in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms subject.

The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization.
Take set of items, each with value and weight, 
specify the number of items to be included in the 
collection, so that the total value is as large as possible 
and total weight is less than or equal to the given limit.
